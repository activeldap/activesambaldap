== Name

ActiveSambaLdap

== Description

ActiveSambaLdap is a library and a management tool for Samba +
LDAP environment.

ActiveSambaLdap provides object-oriented API to manipulate
LDAP entry for Samba. ActiveSambaLdap also provides
command-line tools to replace smbldap-tools written by Perl.

== Licence

Ruby's.

== Dependency libraries

* ActiveLdap >= 1.2.2

== Install

  % sudo gem install activesambaldap

== Mailing list

asl-devel@rubyforge.org

http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/asl-devel/

== Reference manual

http://asl.rubyforge.org/activesambaldap/

== Usage

=== Use with Rails

First, load ActiveSambaLdap gem.

Add the following line into config/environment.rb:

  config.gem "activesambaldap", :lib => "active_samba_ldap"

Next, scaffold the environment of ActiveSambaLdap for Rails.

  % script/generate scaffold_active_samba_ldap

Modify config/ldap.yml generated by
scaffold_active_samba_ldap to adapt to your environment. See
"Options in configuration file" section to find available
options.

==== Populate

First, need to populate your Samba + LDAP environment.
Access http://localhost:3000/samba after invoking Rails by
script/server and so on. And populate your Samba + LDAP
environment by following "Populate Samba + LDAP environment"
link.

And you can development your applications with
User/Computer/Group classes. You can develop like with
ActiveRecord.

=== Use from command line

Use asl-* commands. You'll don't use asl-samba-* commands
from command line because they are for smb.conf.

==== Configuration

First, modify configuration file to adapt to your
environment. You can confirm default configuration files by
invoking asl-* commands with --help option. For example, you
can use asl-populate.

  % asl-populate --help
  ...
        --config=CONFIG              Specify configuration file
                                     Default configuration files:
                                       /etc/activesambaldap/config.yaml
                                       /etc/activesambaldap/bind.yaml
                                       /home/kou/.activesambaldap.conf
                                       /home/kou/.activesambaldap.bind
  ...

Configuration files are read from the above files to the
below files. Configurations are overridden by latter
configuration files. In the above example, configuration
files are read by the following order:

* /etc/activesambaldap/config.yaml
* /etc/activesambaldap/bind.yaml
* /home/kou/.activesambaldap.conf
* /home/kou/.activesambaldap.bind

The reason why bind.yaml and *.bind are read after
config.yaml and *.conf is for security. You should write
opened configurations (host name, port number and so on)
into config.yaml and *.conf, closed configurations (user
name, password and so on) into bind.yaml and *.bind. And you
should set suitable permission to bind.yaml and *.bind.

==== Format of configuration file

Use YAML format. There are three sections:

  update:
    # configurations for updating LDAP entries
    ...

  reference:
    # configurations for referring LDAP entries
    ...

  common:
    # configurations to share for updating/referring
    ...

For example:

  common:
    sid: S-1-5-21-915876905-2926214379-2876160357
    base: dc=samba,dc=local,dc=net
    host: localhost
    method: :tls

  update:
    bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=local,dc=net
    password: admin

  reference:
    allow_anonymous: true

It's best that you write 'password' configuration into
bind.yaml *.bind.

You must configure 'base'. And you should configure
'sid'. You can find your SID by the following command:

  % sudo net getlocalsid

It's inefficiency that sid isn't configured because 'net
getlocalsid' is invoked each time.

==== Options in configuration file

The following options are available:

[_base_]
   Same as the option of ActiveLdap::Base.setup_connection.
[_host_]
   Same as the option of ActiveLdap::Base.setup_connection.

==== Populate

You need to populate your Samba + LDAP environment by
invoking asl-populate before administrate your Samba + LDAP
with asl-*.

  % sudo asl-populate

You can use the following command if you don't need to root
authorization. (root authorization check may be needed...)

  % fakeroot asl-populate

==== Administrate

Use asl-user*, asl-group*, asl-populate,
asl-purge and asl-password. Use --help options for more detail.

==== Configuration of smb.conf

You need to configure you smb.conf like the following if you
want to administrate with
Srvtools[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/173673/]
from Windows or make Samba server domain controller.
Use asl-samba-* for those propose.

  passdb backend = ldapsam:ldap://127.0.0.0
  ldap admin dn = cn=admin,dc=local,dc=net
  ldap suffix = dc=samba,dc=local,dc=net
  ldap user suffix = ou=Users
  ldap group suffix = ou=Groups
  ldap machine suffix = ou=Computers
  ldap idmap suffix = ou=Idmap
  ldap passwd sync = yes

  admin users = "@Domain Admins"
  add user script = /.../asl-samba-useradd "%u"
  delete user script = /.../asl-samba-userdel "%u"
  add group script = /.../asl-samba-groupadd "%g"
  delete group script = /.../asl-samba-groupdel "%g"
  add user to group script = /.../asl-samba-groupmod "%g" --add-members "%u"
  delete user from group script = /.../asl-samba-groupmod "%g" --delete-members "%u"
  set primary group script = /.../asl-samba-usermod "%u" --gid "%g"
  add machine script = /.../asl-samba-computeradd "%u"

You need to set LDAP administrator password by the following
command before invoke your Samba server.

  % sudo /usr/bin/smbpasswd -W

== Trouble shootings

=== Groups aren't listed

You can list groups by the following command:

  % net rpc group list --user=USER_NAME

If no groups listed by the above command after you execute
asl-populate, please confirm the following:

* Is your samba.schema old?

  If your sambaSID entry in your samba.schema doesn't have
  the following configuration, your samba.schema may be old.
  Please update your samba.schema.
